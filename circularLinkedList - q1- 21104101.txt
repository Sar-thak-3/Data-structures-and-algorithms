*************************************QUESTION 1***********************************
Algorithm :-
1) Set head = NULL
2) Then for pushing first element into the circular linked list set this node as head and its pointer to itself!
3) Our circular linked list is created
4) For pushing more elements use do while loop and push element at last node before head
5) Hence we create our circular linked list with any number of nodes!
